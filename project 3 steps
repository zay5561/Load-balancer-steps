The steps i took to complete project 3 are as follows: 

use the gcloud config set compute/region region command to change to 

use the gloud config set compute/zone zone command to chage my zone to us-east1-b

after my configurations were set, I went ahead and created my www1 www2 and ww3 instances using 
the following command for all three:  
--------------------------------------------------
gcloud compute instances create www1 \
    --zone=Zone \
    --tags=network-lb-tag \
    --machine-type=e2-small \
    --image-family=debian-11 \
    --image-project=debian-cloud \
    --metadata=startup-script='#!/bin/bash
      apt-get update
      apt-get install apache2 -y
      service apache2 restart
      echo "
<h3>Web Server: www1</h3>" | tee /var/www/html/index.html'
---------------------------------------------------

I changed the zone to "$ZONE" because that variable is the default zone for this project

after all three instances were created, i created a firewall with the command:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create www-firewall-network-lb \
    --target-tags network-lb-tag --allow tcp:80

Next I used the gcloud compute instances list to get a list of the instances made on the project
